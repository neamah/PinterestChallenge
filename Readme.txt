This is my answer to Code Challenge #2 given by Pinterest for interested internship applicants. 

Two users, A and B, are said to have a cross-source second degree connection, if there exists another user, C that is connected
to user A by source S1 and user B by source S2 and S1 is not equal to S2. 

Write a function that, given two Pinterest user ID's, outputs all corss-sourced second degree connection combinations for these
to users.
